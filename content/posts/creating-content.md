# Creating Content in Hugo

Hugo makes it incredibly easy to create and manage content. All content is written in Markdown, making it simple and portable.

## Content Structure

Hugo organizes content in the `content/` directory. You can create any structure you want:

```
content/
├── posts/
│   ├── my-first-post.md
│   └── another-post.md
├── pages/
│   └── about.md
└── _index.md
```

## Front Matter

Every content file starts with front matter, which contains metadata about the content:

```yaml
---
title: "My Post Title"
date: 2024-01-20T14:30:00Z
draft: false
description: "A brief description of the post"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
categories: ["category1"]
---
```

## Writing Content

After the front matter, you can write your content using Markdown:

- **Bold text** with double asterisks
- *Italic text* with single asterisks
- `Code snippets` with backticks
- [Links](https://example.com) with square brackets

## Creating New Posts

Use Hugo's built-in command to create new posts:

```bash
hugo new posts/my-new-post.md
```

This will create a new post with the default archetype template.

Happy writing!
